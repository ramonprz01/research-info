## 3. Research Agenda Brief

I bundle my current research interests into two broad fields with an increasingly blurry line, computational social science and data science. Within the former, I am mostly interested in the interplay between market design, behavioral sciences, decision making and development economics, while in the latter my focus is on machine learning, statistics, and privacy. One of my goals is to develop new mathematical methods and theories to enable the creation of better and more secure markets that are inclusive of the developing world from the get-go.

Some of the questions I’ve been flirting with in my research agenda tackle a combination of two, three, and more of the topics previously mentioned. For example, (1) markets are becoming increasingly more complex, require more and more data, and pay little-to-no attention to the (2) privacy of individuals. Instead of using the tools we have at our disposal to exploit data collection, targeted advertising, and the profiling of consumers, what would it look like in theory to bake in regulations similar to GDPR into the design of markets? There have been many experiments that compare feature x vs feature y, treatment A vs treatment B, blue background vs red background, and so forth, but what would be the results and implications of comparing two markets, one with privacy as the default option (the treatment group) –where users own their data and get to say who gets to use it and when– with another without this default (the control group)? Is there a difference in happiness (however one might define it), buying habits, and decision making between the groups? While these are all broadly defined ideas and questions I have been putting together for the last few years, I look forward to going down a rabbit hole and bring one, if not more, to life within the right research environment (whether that’s academia or not) in the coming years.

### Current Work

In my role as the Data Scientist and Educator, I focus on teaching data analytics and data science, and in engaging in projects with companies across Australia. As an educator, I teach students how to think and work through the data analytics/science cycle in a programmatic way.

As a researcher in a team of five, I gather, clean, prepare, and analyze datasets within the broader umbrella of management science. Since joining the team at INSEAD, I have been developing models using a corpus of over a terabyte worth of job descriptions from most companies in the US in the last 13 years. One of the initial goals of the project was to determine the vertical and horizontal hierarchies of companies, and to learn by how much and how often these hierarchies change given diverse market conditions. The first classification model I created used the years of experience required for a position to assign roles within a company to four buckets (zero, low, medium, and high level of experience). The second approach involved using a custom-built dictionary of words to determine whether a position was upward looking (e.g. reports to, supervised by, intern, etc.), or downward looking (e.g. supervises, trains, interviews, manages a team, etc.). Once every observation had a label, I used parametric and non-parametric unsupervised algorithms to get an approximation of the hierarchies of companies within their respective industries.

For my own research agenda beyond the project, I am working on building a generative adversarial network (GAN) that generates fake job descriptions for fictitious companies with clearly labelled positions in a made-up org chart. GAN’s make use of the underlying distributions of the features with which the model is trained with, this means that if job descriptions do offer some hierarchical signal about the companies that post them, it might be possible to create a true org chart generator model. The implications of being able to determine this kind of information for any given company using only job descriptions are plenty. At the bare minimum, this could be an additional variable for social scientists studying organizational culture, financial professional’s studying pre- and post-merger/acquisition outcomes, or job seekers looking for additional information about positions well below or above their level of expertise. My ideal practical scenario, if this method succeeds and generalizes well to new data, is that it would create new, or enable existing, markets that provide solutions and products that can be tailored to specific levels and roles within companies.


## 4. Connecting dots between my research agenda and that of potential advisors (Still Updating this section)
- **CMU - Fei Fang** (Website research statement)
  My research interests lie in the area of artificial intelligence, focusing on the integration of computational game theory and learning. **Aiming to address real-world challenges in critical domains such as security, sustainability, and mobility,** my work not only has strong theoretical contributions but also has led to applications that have fundamentally altered current practices in the domains I have worked in. Along the way, I have actively collaborated with researchers and practitioners in diverse disciplines, including computer science, operations research, psychology, **economics**, criminology, conservation biology, and ecology. 

  There is a very high overlap between Prof. Fang's research interest and mine...
